# Concepts and Roles

As an **Open Collaborative** Project, anyone can contribute to anything about the server. This includes starting a new railway line, building new district infrastructures, submitting new models etc.

Since we do not have a rigid system for contributions, here are some concepts about the server, which knowing and understanding them would make all of our life easier:

- ~~New member joins as a **Tourist**, with permission to "interact"(i.e. "Using" the existing facilities), but CANNOT make changes to the world~~ (when the project is opened to public)
- Each can apply for a **Managed Districts** to their own town and district. This will make them a district manager.
  - In the other way round, they could also apply to **join** an existing district for cooperation
- On top of applying for district, one can also apply to start a **Railway Company** and **Railway Lines**. This will make them a line manager.
  - Same as districts, they could also apply to **join** the **Railway Copmany** and help managing the **Railway Lines**

## Managed Districts

?> Issues with district management and how to manage them are being discussed at the moment. The possible candidates are Towny or WorldGuard regions. Tell us what you think on our [discord server](https://discord.gg/AgDKMgQ)

Each piece of land being claimed and managed are called **Managed Districts**. Within these districts, there're
- **District Managers**
  - Plans the development of district (location of infrastructures, street plans etc)
  - Decides the appearence and the overall style of the district (modern, medieval, village style, oriental etc.)
  - Negotiation with Railway Organizations
    - Approve/Deny passing-through railway lines and stations
    - Coordinate with existing railway lines in the district
  - Leads the construction of district
- **District Officers**
  - Basically District Managers, the only different is that the district is not claimed by them
  - (so you have to respect them as the managers
)
> [!WARNING|label:Notice]
> Because of this, any railway lines going through a managed district **must** first obtain **an agreement** from the corresponding **district manager** in order to prevent line collisions or other arguments concerning district development
