# Rules

In addition to the [General Server Rule](https://hub.corecrafted.net/d/7-general-server-rules-v2-1) , some addition rules are applied to the project

## Railway Operators
1. ly make **necessary** changes to the terrain when building rail lines
  - i.e. Removing a mountain for the rail line while a tunnel would do the job, and replacing the whole underground with quartz on metro underground lines etc.
2. Railway passing through managed districts requires agreement from the corresponding district manager
  a. Changing of route for lines inside managed districts must also obtain agreement from district manager
3. Before construction of new line, an adknowledgement consists of rail line plan, locations and height map shoukd be made
  a. Any unknown railway lines are pruned to overlapping or destruction for the sake of fair land usage, lines destroyed with this reason cannot be undone
4. Service frequency should be within an acceptable range, overcrowding the line with trains is prohibited. Violating this may cause the line/railway company to lose the right to run railways in this project
