# PixRail

Welcome to PixRail Metro, the Open Collaborative Railway Project.

This server is operated as part of the CoreCrafted Network, and is maintained and hosted by the CoreCrafted Team

!> This is a **1.12.2** server, please **DO NOT** join with minecraft versions higher than that (i.e. 1.13.X)

## Preperation

The server is aimed to provide the experience of modded server, (nearly) without requiring mods. However, before joining, there's a few items you need to prepare in order to experience 100% of our server.

### Optifine
Optifine is a (personally) must-have mod that speeds up minecraft itself and provide graphics goodies including: 
- Custom Item Texture and Model Support(needed for our trains)
- Shader Support

Since it is a client side performance optimization mod, it can still be used (and is recommended to use) anywhere else, not just our server for better performance on minecraft itself

- You should get yourself a new profile the next time you run your minecraft launcher
- Launch with Optifine Profile

### Resourcepack
We don't use 'server-resourcepack'(that thing that download resourcepack on join) as it introduce CRASH to players that on a weaker computer.

You need to pre-install it yourself before joining

**Easy method:** <br>
Download the pack from our discord announcement [HERE](https://discordapp.com/channels/212825577613295616/553254514648416256/553620680613036032)
- PRO: No procedure, as what you when installing other resourcepacks (recommended to basic users , for now)
- CON: Updates require downloading the whole pack again, unload it, replace it, then reload it (that's not really pleasent to do)

**Advanced GIT method:**<br>
Open your resourcepacks folder, and clone the repository with
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/CoreCrafted-Network/city/resourcepack.git PixRail
```

> [!NOTE]
> You need to have git installed on your computer in order to use this method , and
> 
> This method is **required** for resourcepack contribution (i.e. model and texture)(pull requests)

Update your resourcepack: cd into the PixRail resourcepack, then 
```bash
git pull
```
